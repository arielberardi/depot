# DEPOT

A Book Store Catalog application made entirely in Rails 7 with usage of Hotwire

This was done as a coding along excercise of Part 2 of the book [Agile Web Development with Rails 7](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/)

Nice book, really recomended to start with Rails 7 and learn the new features in it.
